fixtures release notes
----------------------


NEXT
~~~~

3.0.0
~~~~~

* Monkeypatching of callables has been thoroughly overhauled: there were deep
  flaws in usability because staticmethod and classmethods are actually
  descriptors. (Andrew Laski, Robert Collins)

2.0
~~~

* Monkeypatching of staticmethod's now works correctly on Python 2 and 3.
  This is an API break as previously they were bound as instancemethods's
  and thus any working patches need to have their first parameter (self)
  dropped. (Andrew Laski)

* New class ``CompoundFixture`` added, allowing fixtures to be combined.
  (Jonathan Lange)

* Support for Python 3.2 dropped (as pip and setuptools have).
  (Robert Collins)

1.4
~~~

* ``fixtures`` now has CI testing via Travis, no more manual work.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``mock`` is used in preference to ``unittest.mock`` now, as the rolling
  backport has significant bugfixes over older but still supported CPython
  stdlib versions. (Robert Collins)

* ``fixtures.FakeLogger`` now detects incorrectly formatted log messages.
  (John Villalovos, #1503049)

1.3.1
~~~~~

* ``Fixture.setUp`` now uses a bare except: and will thus catch BaseException.
  Any non-Exception-subclass errors are raised verbatim after calling
  ``cleanUp``, to avoid inappropriate masking in callers. (Robert Collins)

1.3.0
~~~~~

* Add MockPatch, MockPatchMultiple, MockPatchObject - adapters to mock.
  (Julien Danjou, Robert Collins)

* Fixture.setUp should no longer be overridden in subclasses. Instead
  override _setUp. This permits the Fixture base class to detect failures
  during _setUp and trigger any registered cleanups, attach any details
  to the failure exception and propagate that to callers. Overriding of
  setUp is still supported: this adds a new interface for simpler
  implementation of the contract of a fixture.
  (Robert Collins, #1456361, #1456353)

1.2.0
~~~~~

* Add warnings module fixture for capturing warnings. (Joshua Harlow)

1.1.0
~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* FakeLogger now supports a custom formatter. (Sean Dague)

* Fixed test performance on Python 3.5. PEP 475 led to ``time.sleep()`` not
  being interrupted when a received signal handler eats the signal (rather
  than raising an exception). (Robert Collins)

* ``tox.ini`` added, for folk that use tox. (Sean Dague)

1.0.0
~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* Fix incorrect entry_point. (Gabi Davar)

0.3.17
~~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* FakeLogger now supports the ``datefmt`` parameter.
  (Sean Dague)

* Fixtures source code is now hosted on
  `github <https://github.com/testing-cabal/fixtures>`_.
  (Robert Collins)

0.3.16
~~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* Fixed 0.3.15 on Python 2.6 - version info is a plain tuple there.
  (Robert Collins)

0.3.15
~~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* ``FakePopen`` now supports being called under a context manager (IE: with).
  (Steve Kowalik)

* ``FakeProcess`` now supports kill(). (Steve Kowalik)

* ``FakeProcess`` wait() now supports arguments added in Python 3.
  (Steve Kowalik)

* ``MonkeyPatch`` now preserves ``staticmethod`` functions.
  (Dan Kenigsberg)

0.3.14
~~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* ``FakePopen`` can now override the returncode attribute.
  (Robert Collins)

0.3.13
~~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* Documentation hopefully covers ``TestWithFixtures`` a little better.
  (Robert Collins, #1102688)

* ``FakePopen`` now accepts all the parameters available in Python 2.7.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``FakePopen`` now only passes parameters to the get_info routine if the
  caller supplied them. (Robert Collins)

* ``setup.py`` now lists the ``testtools`` dependency which was missing.
  (Robert Collins, #1103823)

0.3.12
~~~~~~

Brown bag fix up of StringStream from 0.3.11.

0.3.11
~~~~~~

CHANGES
-------

* ``DetailStream`` was ambiguous about whether it handled bytes or characters,
  which matters a lot for Python3. It now is deprecated with ByteStream and
  StringStream replacing it. (Robert Collins)

* Fixtures is now Python3 compatible. (Robert Collins)

* ``FakeLogger`` has been split out into a ``LogHandler`` fixture that can
  inject arbitrary handlers, giving more flexability. (Jonathan Lange)

* pydoc is recommended as a source of info about fixtures.
  (Robert Collins, #812845)

* The docs for fixtures have been updated to cover the full API.
  (Robert Collins, #1071649)

0.3.10
~~~~~~

New ``DetailStream`` fixture to add file-like object content to testtools
details, cleanup logic factored out into a CallMany class.

CHANGES:

* Add ``join`` method to ``TempDir`` to more readily get paths relative
  to a temporary directory.  (Jonathan Lange)

* Factor out new ``CallMany`` class to isolate the cleanup logic.
  (Robert Collins)

* New ``DetailStream`` fixture to add file-like object content to testtools
  details. This allows for easy capture of sys.stdout and sys.stderr for
  example. (Clark Boylan)

0.3.9
~~~~~

New ``TempHomeDir`` fixture and more log output included in ``FakeLogger``.

CHANGES:

* New TempHomeDir fixture to create and activate a temporary home directory.
  (James Westby)

* ``FakeLogger`` now includes the output from python logging - the .output
  attribute as a content object in getDetails, so the logs will automatically
  be included in failed test output (or other similar circumstances).
  (Francesco Banconi)

0.3.8
~~~~~

Simpler names for a number of fixtures, and two new fixtures NestedTempfile and
Timeout. See the manual for more information.

CHANGES:

* EnvironmentVariable now upcalls via super().
  (Jonathan Lange, #881120)

* EnvironmentVariableFixture, LoggerFixture, PopenFixture renamed to
  EnvironmentVariable, FakeLogger and FakePopen respectively. All are still
  available under their old, deprecated names.  (Jonathan Lange, #893539)

* gather_details fixed to handle the case where two child fixtures have the
  same detail name. (Jonathan Lange, #895652)

* ``NestedTempfile`` which will change the default path for tempfile temporary
  file / directory creation. (Gavin Panella)

* New Timeout fixture.  (Martin Pool)

0.3.7
~~~~~

CHANGES:

* New fixture LoggerFixture which replaces a logging module logger.
  (Free Ekanayaka)

* On Python 2.7 and above the _fixtures tests are no longer run twice.
  (Robert Collins)

* Python 3 now supported. (Jonathan Lange, #816665)

* ``TempDir`` supports creating the temporary directory under a specific path.
  An example of where this is useful would be if you have some specific long
  lived temporary items and need to avoid running afoul of tmpreaper.
  (Robert Collins, #830757)

* Updated to match the changed ``gather_details`` API in testtools. See #801027.
  This is an incompatible change in testtools and requires testtools 0.9.12.
  (Jonathan Lange)

0.3.6
~~~~~

Another small API break - sorry. Fixture.getDetails no longer returns the
internal details dict (self._details). Access that directly if needed. It now
looks for details in used fixtures and returns those as well as details added
directly.

CHANGES:

* Details from child fixtures for both Fixture and TestWithFixtures no longer
  quash same-named details if testtools 0.9.11 is available (for the
  gather_details helper).
  (Gavin Panella, #796253)

* Fixture.getDetails will now return all the details of fixtures added using
  useFixture. (RobertCollins, #780806)

* New fixture ``PackagePathEntry`` which patches the path of an existing
  package, allowing importing part of it from another directory.
  (Robert Collins)

* New fixture ``PythonPathEntry`` which patches sys.path.
  (Robert Collins, #737503)

* Test failure on some setups in
  test_cleanUp_raise_first_false_callscleanups_returns_exceptions.
  (Gavin Panella, #796249)

* Testtools 0.9.8 is now a minimum requirement.
  (Gavin Panella)

0.3.5
~~~~~

CHANGES:

* New fixture ``MonkeyPatch`` which patches (or deletes) an existing attribute
  and restores it afterwards. (Robert Collins)

* New fixture ``PythonPackage`` which manages a temporary python package.
  (Robert Collins)

* New fixture ``TempDir`` which manages a temporary directory. (Robert Collins)

0.3.4
~~~~~

CHANGES:

* Fixture now supports ``addDetail`` and provides a``getDetails`` call
  compatible with the ``testtools.TestCase`` calls. (Robert Collins, #640119)

* New helper ``MethodFixture`` for wrapping an object similarly to
  ``FunctionFixture`` (Robert Collins)

0.3.3
~~~~~

Fixtures now have a ``useFixture`` method as well, making nesting of fixtures
trivial.

CHANGES:

* New method ``Fixture.useFixture`` allowing fixtures to compose other
  fixtures. (Robert Collins)

0.3.2
~~~~~

Point release adding new EnvironmentVariableFixture for controlling environment
variables.

CHANGES:

* New EnvironmentVariableFixture which can set or unset environment variables.
  (Robert Collins)

0.3.1
~~~~~

Point release adding experimental PopenFixture.

CHANGES:

* Experimental PopenFixture providing a test double for testing code that runs
  external processes. (Robert Collins)

0.3
~~~

This release slightly breaks compatability in order to get the cleanUp API
really solid : it now will report correctly with testtools 0.9.7, and 
generally does the right thing by default. Apologies to anyone affected by
this churn, but I felt the cleanness of the API was worth it.

CHANGES:

* When multiple exceptions are being raised from cleanUp, MultipleExceptions
  is used to report them all. This is preferentially imported from testtools
  and failing that defined locally. See testtools 0.9.7 for its use.
  (Robert Collins)

0.2
~~~

CHANGES:

* Exceptions raised during cleanup are no longer silently swallowed. They
  are returned in a list by default, or the first one is raised if raise_first
  is supplied. The TestCase glue code passes raise_first to cleanUp.
  (Robert Collins, #629032)

0.1
~~~

CHANGES:

* Created project. The primary interfaces are
  ``fixtures.TestWithFixtures`` and ``fixtures.Fixture``.
  Documentation is primarily in README.  (Robert Collins)
