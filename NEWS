fixtures release notes
----------------------


IN DEVELOPMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0.3.6
~~~~~

Another small API break - sorry. Fixture.getDetails no longer returns the
internal details dict (self._details). Access that directly if needed. It now
looks for details in used fixtures and returns those as well as details added
directly.

CHANGES:

* Details from child fixtures for both Fixture and TestWithFixtures no longer
  quash same-named details if testtools 0.9.11 is available (for the
  gather_details helper).
  (Gavin Panella, #796253)

* Fixture.getDetails will now return all the details of fixtures added using
  useFixture. (RobertCollins, #780806)

* New fixture ``PackagePathEntry`` which patches the path of an existing
  package, allowing importing part of it from aonther directory.
  (Robert Collins)

* New fixture ``PythonPathEntry`` which patches sys.path.
  (Robert Collins, #737503)

* Test failure on some setups in
  test_cleanUp_raise_first_false_callscleanups_returns_exceptions.
  (Gavin Panella, #796249)

* Testtools 0.9.8 is now a minimum requirement.
  (Gavin Panella)

0.3.5
~~~~~

CHANGES:

* New fixture ``MonkeyPatch`` which patches (or deletes) an existing attribute
  and restores it afterwards. (Robert Collins)

* New fixture ``PythonPackage`` which manages a temporary python package.
  (Robert Collins)

* New fixture ``TempDir`` which manages a temporary directory. (Robert Collins)

0.3.4
~~~~~

CHANGES:

* Fixture now supports ``addDetail`` and provides a``getDetails`` call
  compatible with the ``testtools.TestCase`` calls. (Robert Collins, #640119)

* New helper ``MethodFixture`` for wrapping an object similarly to
  ``FunctionFixture`` (Robert Collins)

0.3.3
~~~~~

Fixtures now have a ``useFixture`` method as well, making nesting of fixtures
trivial.

CHANGES:

* New method ``Fixture.useFixture`` allowing fixtures to compose other
  fixtures. (Robert Collins)

0.3.2
~~~~~

Point release adding new EnvironmentVariableFixture for controlling environment
variables.

CHANGES:

* New EnvironmentVariableFixture which can set or unset environment variables.
  (Robert Collins)

0.3.1
~~~~~

Point release adding experimental PopenFixture.

CHANGES:

* Experimental PopenFixture providing a test double for testing code that runs
  external processes. (Robert Collins)

0.3
~~~

This release slightly breaks compatability in order to get the cleanUp API
really solid : it now will report correctly with testtools 0.9.7, and 
generally does the right thing by default. Apologies to anyone affected by
this churn, but I felt the cleanness of the API was worth it.

CHANGES:

* When multiple exceptions are being raised from cleanUp, MultipleExceptions
  is used to report them all. This is preferentially imported from testtools
  and failing that defined locally. See testtools 0.9.7 for its use.
  (Robert Collins)

0.2
~~~

CHANGES:

* Exceptions raised during cleanup are no longer silently swallowed. They
  are returned in a list by default, or the first one is raised if raise_first
  is supplied. The TestCase glue code passes raise_first to cleanUp.
  (Robert Collins, #629032)

0.1
~~~

CHANGES:

* Created project. The primary interfaces are
  ``fixtures.TestWithFixtures`` and ``fixtures.Fixture``.
  Documentation is primarily in README.  (Robert Collins)
