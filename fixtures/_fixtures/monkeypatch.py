        When patching methods, the call signature of name should be a subset
        of the parameters which can be used to call new_value.

        Patching N.newmethod on top of T.method and then calling T().method(1)
        will not work because they do not have compatible call signatures -
        self will be passed to newmethod because the callable (N.newmethod)
        is placed onto T as a regular function. This allows capturing all the
