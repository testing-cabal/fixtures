    """Prevent calls to deprecated functions.

    This fixture can be added to a testcase to ensure that the code under test
    isn't calling deprecated function. It sets Python's `warnings` module for
    the module under test to "error" so that DeprecationWarning will be
    raised.

    You might want your application to not use any deprecated function.
    Deprecated function is going to be removed and sometimes is being removed
    because it's buggy and you shouldn't be using it.

    It can be difficult to tell just through code reviews that new code is
    calling deprecated function. This fixture can be used to protect you from
    developers proposing changes that use deprecated function.

    It can also be useful to be able to test if your application is still using
    some function that's been newly deprecated.

    .. note:: This fixture uses :func:`warnings.catch_warnings`, as such the
        note there applies: The fixture modifies global state and therefore is
        not thread safe.

    :param str module: The name of a Python module. DeprecationWarnings emitted
                       from this module will cause an error to be raised.
