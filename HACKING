Contributing to fixtures
========================

Code access
+++++++++++

Branch from the trunk (all patches should be for trunk unless there are
exceptional circumstances)::

  git clone https://github.com/testing-cabal/fixtures path-to-new-local-repo

Publish your branches whereever you like and submit PR's on github.

Copyright
+++++++++

Fixtures is Copyright (C) 2010-2014 Robert Collins. I'd like to be able to
offer it up for stdlib inclusion once it has proved itself, so am asking for
copyright assignment to me - or for your contributions to be under the BSD and
Apache-2.0 licences that Fixtures is under (which permit inclusion in Python).

Coding standards
++++++++++++++++

PEP-8 coding style please, though perfection isn't needed. Make sure that 'make
check' passes before sending in a patch.

Code arrangement
++++++++++++++++

The ``fixtures`` module should simply import classes and functions from
more specific modules, rather than becoming large and bloated itself. For
instance, TestWithFixtures lives in fixtures.testcase, and is imported in
the fixtures __init__.py.
