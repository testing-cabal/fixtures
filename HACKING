Contributing to fixtures
========================

Code access
+++++++++++

Branch from the trunk (all patches should be for trunk unless there are
exceptional circumstances)::

  bzr branch lp:python-fixtures path-to-new-local-branch

Publish your branches whereever you like, I encourage Launchpad hosting though,
as it can notify the community of new fixtures branches::

  bzr push lp:~YOURUSERNAME/python-fixtures/YOURBRANCHNAME

Copyright
+++++++++

Fixtures is Copyright (C) 2010 Robert Collins. I'd like to be able to
offer it up for stdlib inclusion once it has proved itself, so am asking for
copyright assignment to me - or for your contributions to be under the BSD and
Apache-2.0 licences that Fixtures is under (which permit inclusion in Python).

Coding standards
++++++++++++++++

PEP-8 coding style please, though perfection isn't needed. Make sure that 'make
check' passes before sending in a patch.

Code arrangement
++++++++++++++++

The ``fixtures`` module should simply import classes and functions from
more specific modules, rather than becoming large and bloated itself. For
instance, TestWithFixtures lives in fixtures.testcase, and is imported in
the fixtures __init__.py.
